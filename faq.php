Can I lose money?

  there are a few simple ways that can help you to reduce the risk of losing more than 
  you can afford to. First, align your investments with your financial goals, 
  in other words, keep the money you may need for the short-term out of more aggressive 
  investments, reserving those investment funds for the money you intend to raise 
  over the long-term. It's very important for you to know that we are real traders 
  and that we invest members' funds on major investments.</div>
